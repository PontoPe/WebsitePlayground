    title: "YOLOv8 vs. Global Elites: Analyzing CS:GO Demos with Computer Vision",
    date: "15 Jan 2026",
    author: "Pedro Martins",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    content: `As a former professional CS:GO player, I know the difference between victory and defeat is measured in milliseconds and pixels. But as an AI Engineer, I asked myself: "Can a machine identify tactical patterns we miss?"\n\nThe Challenge:\nReplay files (.dem) are just raw vector data. They don't show "what the player saw." To truly analyze aim efficiency and crosshair placement, I needed to process the rendered video frame by frame.\n\nThe Architecture:\nI trained a custom YOLOv8n (Nano) model focused exclusively on character "hitboxes" in low-contrast environments (like Dust2's tunnels).\n\nThe pipeline was built in Python:\n1. Video ingestion via OpenCV (cv2).\n2. Real-time inference using CUDA (GPU acceleration).\n3. IoU (Intersection over Union) calculation to determine if the crosshair was on the model *before* the shot was fired.\n\nResults:\nThe system generated "pre-visualization" heatmaps, revealing that Tier 1 players keep their crosshair in high-probability appearance zones 87% of the time, compared to 62% for amateur players—even when no enemy is visible.\n\nThis proves that "Game Sense" can, indeed, be mathematically quantified.`,

    title: "Killing the Monolith: Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka & Python",
    date: "22 Dec 2025",
    author: "Pedro Martins",
    readTime: "12 min read",
    content: `The most common mistake junior backend developers make is assuming the database is infinite. In enterprise systems (like those I architected for Hyundai and JBS), attempting a synchronous write to Postgres for every sensor event is architectural suicide.\n\nThe Latency Problem:\nWhen dealing with 50,000 requests per second (RPS), database locks create a cascading effect. The API chokes, the Load Balancer times out, and the system crashes.\n\nThe Solution: Asynchronous Decoupling.\nI implemented an architecture where the API (FastAPI) is "dumb and fast." It essentially receives the JSON, validates the schema (Pydantic), and pushes the message to an Apache Kafka topic. Response time: < 15ms.\n\nOn the other side, we have Python "Consumers" running in isolated Docker containers. They read from Kafka at a pace the database can handle (Backpressure Handling).\n\nPatterns Used:\n- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separating read and write operations to optimize heavy queries.\n- **Dead Letter Queues:** If a message fails processing, it doesn't block the queue; it's sent to a DLQ for later analysis.\n\nThis approach transformed a fragile system into a fortress capable of processing Terabytes of data without losing a single packet.`,

    title: "Data Sovereignty: Running Local RAG Agents with Llama-3 & LangChain",
    date: "05 Nov 2025",
    author: "Pedro Martins",
    readTime: "10 min read",
    content: `The cloud is convenient, but privacy is non-negotiable. Recently, I was challenged to build an AI assistant for analyzing sensitive legal contracts. Sending this data to OpenAI via API was out of the question.\n\nThe "Offline" Stack:\nTo solve this, I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system running entirely locally on a single RTX 4090 GPU.\n\n1. **The LLM:** I used Llama-3-8B quantized to 4-bits (GGUF). Quantization is magic: we lose less than 2% accuracy to gain 4x speed and drastically reduce VRAM usage.\n2. **Vector Store:** ChromaDB running in a container to index the contract PDFs.\n3. **Orchestration:** LangChain to connect the nodes.\n\nThe Agent:\nI didn't just build a chatbot. I implemented a "ReAct" (Reasoning + Acting) pattern. The model doesn't just answer; it "thinks":\n*Thought:* The user wants to know the termination clause.\n*Action:* Search VectorDB for "termination" and "fine".\n*Observation:* Found paragraph 4.2.\n*Final Answer:* The fine is 10%...\n\nThe future of AI isn't just bigger models, but specialized models running at the edge (Edge AI), where user data remains secure.`,
